# Intro

Hi, I'm Rutvik Trivedi, an aspiring data scientist with a passion for blending cutting-edge technology with real-world impact. Currently, I'm pursuing a postgraduate degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science in Canada while working as a Machine Learning Intern at Traveltical Inc. I specialize in building AI-driven solutions, crafting data pipelines, and deploying machine learning models that simplify decision-making processes for businesses.

Previously, I worked as a Technical Support Analyst at GaoTek Inc., AI Engineer at Radical AI, and Software Developer at O2 International LLP, gaining experience in developing innovative solutions across diverse domains. If you're working on a challenging data problem or are building AI tools with real-world applications, let's connect—I'd love to collaborate and help!

# Some History

- When I was 10, I got my first computer and fell in love with technology. My curiosity soon led me to learn programming, and I wrote my first "Hello World" in Python at 15.
- In college, I delved into machine learning, starting with simple predictive models before venturing into deep learning and NLP.
- At 18, I developed a web scraping tool as a side project to automate repetitive tasks, which saved me and my peers countless hours.
- At 20, I published my first capstone project on building a recommendation system.
- By 22, I had already worked on several hands-on projects, including a face expression recognition model using transfer learning and a real-time Streamlit app, which further deepened my love for applying AI to human-centered challenges.
- I’ve consistently combined academic knowledge with professional experience to build a solid foundation in data science, big data frameworks, and cloud computing tools.

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
